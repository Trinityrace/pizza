<!-- Goal
The goal of this week's Independent Project is to help us practice and 
understand better the concepts that we have covered throughout this week.
 These include working with constructors, prototypes, objects, properties,
 and methods in Javascript as well as using jQuery and DOM manipulation & traversal.

Overall Project Description
You own a pizza place and as a way of trying to widen your customer base, 
you decide to create a web application where your customers order 
different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings. 

Be sure to give your application a suitable catchy name.

User Stories
As a customer, I would like to;
-Choose the size of the pizza and 
each pizza size has an allocated price

-Choose a crust and each 
crust has an allocated price

-Choose any topping they want and 
each topping has an allocated price 
depending on the size of the pizza they chose earlier.
The customer is also able to choose more than one topping.

 -Place an order and 
 get the full charge of the pizza ordered.

-Order more than 1 pizza

-Option for delivery and he/she is
 shown the price for delivery.

-If the pizza is to be delivered, the customer is prompted
 to enter their location and they get an alert that their
 order will be delivered to their location once they check out.

-Upon Checkout, the customer is able to see the summary 
 of all the orders they placed with their respective 
 prices and finally the grand total charge

Requirements
Determine the prices for each pizza size.
Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
Determine the cost for the crust
The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ 
summary together with the total amount charged. For example, 
if the customer has made more than one pizza order, 
on checkout the application displays a summary of all the 
orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.

Project Objectives
The project code uses constructors in Javascript.
The project makes use of prototypes in Javascript.
The project implements one or more Javascript functions.
The project separates the business logic code from the UI logic code.
The web app uses bootstrap and media queries to make it fully responsive.
The javascript code uses the correct syntax of camel case naming of variables.
 I.e var myVariable = "stores something"; instead of var my_var = "stores something",
  or, var MyVar = "stores something" , or, 
   var my-Var = "stores something"
